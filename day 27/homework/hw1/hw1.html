            Wanda Maximoff first appeared in X-Men #4 (1964), created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. She was
            introduced as one of the villains, a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, alongside her twin brother,
            Pietro Maximoff, aka Quicksilver.

            2. Origin and Backstory:
            Wanda Maximoff was born in the Eastern European country of Sokovia to Magda and Magnus (later revealed to be
            Magneto, the famous mutant villain). Her early life was filled with hardship, including the loss of her
            parents. She and her brother Pietro were experimented on by the villain Baron Strucker, which awakened their
            mutant powers. Pietro's super-speed and Wanda's probability-altering powers allowed them to become
            formidable individuals.

            For a time, Wanda and Pietro were portrayed as antagonists, aligning with Magneto's cause. However, the
            siblings later defected to the side of the heroes, joining the Avengers, where Wanda’s powers were explored
            in greater depth.

        <p id="p2">
            Powers and Abilities:
            Wanda Maximoff's primary power is her ability to manipulate chaos magic, which gives her control over the
            fabric of reality itself. Some of her most notable abilities include:

            Reality Manipulation: Wanda can alter the laws of physics and change reality itself, which can have massive
            consequences.
            Telekinesis: She can manipulate objects with her mind.
            Energy Projection: Wanda can generate powerful energy blasts.
            Probability Alteration: Originally, her powers were described as the ability to alter probabilities, which
            often had unpredictable effects (such as causing bad luck for her enemies).
            Telepathy: She also has limited telepathic abilities, such as creating illusions or controlling minds.
            Over time, her powers have been shown to be far more potent, with her ability to manipulate reality at a
            god-like scale.

            4. The Vision and Family:
            Wanda's relationship with the android Vision is central to her character’s story arc. She and Vision formed
            a romantic bond, and they were eventually married in the comics. They also had children, although their
            existence was complicated due to Wanda's manipulation of reality.

            In a famous storyline called "House of M", Wanda’s grief over the loss of her children led her to alter the
            entire fabric of reality, creating an alternate world in which mutants were the dominant species. This led
            to the creation of the phrase "No More Mutants," which dramatically reduced the mutant population.

            5. Notable Storylines:
            House of M: Wanda’s grief causes her to reshape reality, creating an alternate world where mutants rule.
            This leads to the famous moment where she utters, "No More Mutants," drastically reducing the number of
            mutants on Earth.

            Avengers Disassembled: Wanda’s instability causes the Avengers to fall apart, as her powers manifest
            uncontrollably, resulting in the destruction of the Avengers team.

            The Scarlet Witch's Chaos Magic: Wanda’s powers were later revealed to be tied to Chaos Magic, which makes
            her one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.

            The Children of Wanda Maximoff: A key part of Wanda's journey is her children, Billy and Tommy, who were
            initially created from Wanda’s magic but were later erased. However, they were reborn in the comics as the
            superheroes Wiccan and Speed.

            6. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU):
            In the MCU, Wanda Maximoff, portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen, has a slightly different origin and
            characterization, but many of her core traits are retained. She first appears in Avengers: Age of Ultron
            (2015), where she initially works with Ultron against the Avengers, alongside her brother Pietro. Over time,
            she becomes a core member of the Avengers and plays a key role in subsequent films.

            WandaVision: In this Disney+ series (2021), Wanda's grief over Vision's death leads her to create a pocket
            reality where she and Vision live a suburban life. The show explores Wanda’s emotional struggles, her
            powers, and her transformation into the Scarlet Witch. In this series, she fully embraces her title as the
            Scarlet Witch, a being with vast magical powers.

            Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022): Wanda becomes one of the main antagonists, as she seeks
            to use the multiverse to reunite with her children, ultimately leading to tragic consequences.
