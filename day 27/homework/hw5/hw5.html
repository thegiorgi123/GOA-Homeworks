            Sylvester Stallone is an American actor, director, producer, and screenwriter, best known for creating and
            starring in two of the most iconic film franchises in history: Rocky and Rambo. Stallone is recognized for
            his physical presence, gritty performances, and perseverance in the face of adversity, both on and
            off-screen. His career has spanned more than five decades, and he remains one of the most influential
            figures in Hollywood. Here’s an overview of his life, career, and legacy:

            1. Early Life
            Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone was born on July 6, 1946, in New York City, to Frank Stallone Sr., an Italian
            immigrant hairdresser, and Jacqueline Stallone, an astrologer, dancer, and promoter of women’s wrestling.
            Stallone faced several challenges early in life. He was born with a paralytic birth defect, causing his
            lower lip to be droopy and impairing his speech, which made him a target for bullying.

            Stallone was a rebellious student and attended several schools, eventually graduating from Miami Dade
            College and University of Miami with a degree in economics. He was passionate about acting and began his
            career in New York City, taking small roles in theater and television while struggling financially.

            2. Early Career and Struggles
            Before his rise to fame, Stallone worked a variety of jobs, including as a janitor and a waiter. His big
            break came when he wrote the screenplay for a film that would change his life: "Rocky" (1976).

            In the early 1970s, Stallone appeared in several films, most notably "The Party at Kitty and Stud's" (1970),
            a soft-core pornographic film in which Stallone had a small role. At the time, he was living in poverty,
            often struggling to make ends meet. He also had small roles in films like "Bananas" (1971), directed by
            Woody Allen, and "Death Race 2000" (1975).

            3. "Rocky" and Breakthrough
            Stallone's big break came with "Rocky" (1976), a film he both wrote and starred in. The story of an underdog
            boxer, Rocky Balboa, who gets a shot at the heavyweight title, resonated with audiences around the world.
            Stallone's portrayal of the humble, hard-working boxer, fighting against all odds to make his dream come
            true, earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. The film itself won three Academy Awards,
            including Best Picture, and Stallone became an instant star.

            The success of "Rocky" (1976) marked the beginning of Stallone's career as a major Hollywood actor and
            cemented his place as a leading figure in American cinema. He continued to reprise the role of Rocky Balboa
            in multiple sequels, including:

            Rocky II (1979)
            Rocky III (1982)
            Rocky IV (1985)
            Rocky V (1990)
            Rocky Balboa (2006)
            Creed (2015) and Creed II (2018), where he passed the torch to the new generation.
            The "Rocky" films not only solidified Stallone’s place as an action star but also showcased his talent for
            writing and producing.

            4. The "Rambo" Franchise
            After the success of "Rocky", Stallone went on to create another iconic character: John Rambo, a troubled
            Vietnam War veteran. The first film in the series, "First Blood" (1982), introduced the world to the
            character of Rambo, a soldier struggling to adjust to civilian life and facing off against a corrupt sheriff
            in a small town. The film was a hit and spawned several sequels, including:

            Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985)
            Rambo III (1988)
            Rambo (2008)
            Rambo: Last Blood (2019)
            The "Rambo" series became synonymous with action, tough-guy machismo, and explosive violence, with
            Stallone's portrayal of the tormented hero resonating with many fans.

            5. Other Notable Films
            Aside from "Rocky" and "Rambo," Stallone starred in numerous successful films, many of which showcased his
            action hero persona. Some of the most notable include:

            which featured a cast of action stars including Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and
            Bruce Willis.
            6. Directorial and Writing Achievements
