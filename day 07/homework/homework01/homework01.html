<h3><p>
    The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films are a series of American superhero films produced by Marvel Studios based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. The MCU is the shared universe in which all of the films are set. The films have been in production since 2007, and in that time Marvel Studios has produced and released 34 films, with at least 10 more in various stages of development. It is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $31.1 billion at the global box office. This includes Avengers: Endgame, which became the highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release.

    The films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often ensemble, casts. Kevin Feige has produced every film in the franchise, while other Marvel Studios executives have also produced some films alongside Feige. Other individuals have also produced select MCU films, including Gale Anne Hurd for The Incredible Hulk; Amy Pascal for the Spider-Man films; Lauren Shuler Donner, Ryan Reynolds, and Shawn Levy for Deadpool & Wolverine; and Anthony and Joe Russo for Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars.
