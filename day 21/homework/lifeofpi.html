            Life of Pi is a philosophical adventure novel by Canadian author Yann Martel, first published in 2001. The
            story follows a young Indian boy named Pi Patel, who survives a shipwreck in the Pacific Ocean. After the
            disaster, Pi is left stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, along with a zebra, a
            hyena, and an orangutan. The novel explores themes of survival, faith, storytelling, and the human spirit.

            Here’s a more detailed look at the key elements of Life of Pi:

            Plot Overview:
            Pi Patel lives in Pondicherry, India, where his father owns a zoo. He is a curious and intelligent child who
            practices multiple religions (Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam) simultaneously, seeking spiritual
            enlightenment. However, his life takes a drastic turn when his family decides to emigrate to Canada,
            bringing several zoo animals aboard a Japanese ship, the Tsimtsum.

            The ship encounters a severe storm and sinks, leaving Pi as the only human survivor. He finds himself on a
            lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, a zebra, a hyena, and an orangutan. Over the course of
            227 days at sea, Pi struggles to survive while trying to coexist with Richard Parker, who could easily kill
            him. The novel explores Pi’s physical and emotional survival, as well as his spiritual journey.
