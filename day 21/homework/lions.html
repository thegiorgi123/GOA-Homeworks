                The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a
                muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of
                its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
                It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males,
                related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized
                and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
                opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
                prey on humans.

                The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild
                cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic
                period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been
                reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been
                listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have
                declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected
                areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans
                are the greatest causes for concern.
